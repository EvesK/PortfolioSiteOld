    <p class = 'text-justify'>Collaborative Design, or CD, is an Olin College course where I “learn[ed] firsthand how to do design with people—not for them, on their behalf, but with them, involving them in the process all along the way” (CD Course Statement, 2022). As part of this course I led a team of four as we interviewed stakeholders, analyzed and synthesized learnings, co-designed with users, and developed a project proposal to address a need we discovered in the mutual aid community. This course taught me, more than anything, how to develop a deep empathy with my user group and respectfully interact with their community to learn more about them and their needs. </p>

    <p class = 'text-justify'>At the end of the course we proposed an organization called ‘The Garden’, a space where visitors learn about mutual aid opportunities, connect with others in the mutual aid space, and grow the skills and knowledge they need for their mutual aid work. The Garden addresses a need we identified; mutual aid organizers need skills and knowledge to maintain their organizations, but they don’t have the time or resources to find people with this knowledge or develop these skills among their volunteers. We prototyped a physical model of the space, a small community garden with a large gazebo for events and community building, as well as a website that supports the physical space. But the real deliverables for the course were the copious materials we generated to explore, analyze, and synthesize the massive amounts of information collected from our users. </p>

    <p class = 'text-justify'>This course focused heavily on interviewing and co-designing methods as well as developing the skills needed to parse and dig through all of the nuanced information we collected. Some of the analyzing and synthesizing methods I explored throughout this course included Card Sorting, Attribute Spectrum Mapping, Personality Trait Mapping, and People Portraits. My team and I also developed four detailed, comprehensive personas for our user group. At the end of the course, I prototyped and represented ideas using Paper Prototyping, Gallery Sketches, Interaction and Journey Maps, Before/After Scenarios, and Physical and Digital Prototyping. </p>
