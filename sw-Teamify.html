    <p class = 'text-justify'>UXD is a “hands-on exploration of the design and development of user interfaces” (UXD Course Description), an advanced design course offered at Olin College. In this course we covered a variety of user experience topics, everything from constructing needs analyses to proto-personas to nielsen’s heuristics. I conducted deep dives into products in my everyday life, looking at them through the lens of user experience. I read up on atomic design, usability testing, and information architecture. I learned about signifiers, affordances, and fidelity. And I applied everything I learned, as I learned it, to our project.</p>

    <p class = 'text-justify'>Teamify is a website that fosters discussion by gamifying the process of team norming. Users are brought through a series of questions and prompts, answering them individually before coming together to discuss the results. To be completely honest; I had a lot of trouble working with this team. Details aside, not one of my teammates had completed any of the prerequisite courses and they entered this course with significantly less design knowledge than I did. As such, our project was completed at an introductory level not suited to my experience. It would be easy to blame someone or to create an excuse. But instead I would like to tell you what I learned.</p>

    <p class = 'text-justify'>I learned how to negotiate views significantly different than my own; how to argue my position but also how to compromise. I learned how to explain design concepts in the simplest terms and how to effectively pitch eccentric design techniques to skeptical colleagues. And I learned how to step back and give my teammates space to experiment and fail and learn at their level while carving out my own space to work on my skills.</p>

    <p class = 'text-justify'>While I would not present the final product as an accurate portrayal of my quality of work, I do think I learned a lot from this project and this course.</p>
