    <p class = 'text-justify'>Take a look around. Explore. This project page is all about websiteurl.com. This site was designed in Figma and coded entirely from scratch in HTML and CSS (with a bit of JavaScript thrown in here and there). I built this site as a place to demonstrate my work but also as a challenge to myself. After over two years of modifying pre-made templates and inserting CSS widgets into website builders, I challenged myself to create something entirely unique, starting with a blank page.</p>

    <p class = 'text-justify'>I’ve started with a lot of blank pages throughout this project. The first was the college ruled page of a notebook. It was on this page that I began to sketch out ideas for my site. Iterations filled the pages, idea after idea. Next came the cursor, blinking against a bright white page as I grappled with what to write, how to tell my stories. Then the Untitled Figma document, a light gray canvas. Soon this page filled too, text and images covering the screen. Colors began to unfold, shades of purple and blue. My color contrast checker found a permanent home in the top right corner of my screen as I tested every iteration, every combination for accessibility. Then, finally, the coding window, dark and empty. I filled this window with tags and links, padding and wrapping. With every new type of screen I went back to the beginning, Sketching - Writing - Figma - Code, until I had a launch ready site. </p>

    <p class = 'text-justify'>That isn’t to say this website is done. If anything, this is the first test. One thing I have learned about accessibility is that there is no end point; the only way to be truly accessible is to continue iterating, to always see something ahead. I plan to continue editing and updating this site the more I learn. </p>
