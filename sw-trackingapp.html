    <p class = 'text-justify'>I have struggled for years to find medical tracking apps that work for me. As I investigated all of the options, I first began to notice the assumptions embedded in these types of apps. The menstrual cycle tracking app that assumes the user can become pregnant, or the healthy eating app that can’t imagine someone whose goal isn’t to lose weight. Then I noticed how many of these apps I was using for a single aspect of my health. Every day I went from a medication tracking app to keep track of dosages to a timer app for reminders (the ones from the medication app didn’t work for me) and a notes app to write down side effects. Not to mention searching the calendar app to remember the date of my last doctor’s appointment or digging into my email history to find my last round of test results every few months. I quickly learned I was not alone as I heard story after story of tracking app struggles, everything from a non-binary individual who had to delete years of history over the intense dysphoria their menstrual cycle tracking app caused to an individual with chronic pain who had to design a massive spreadsheet to track symptoms with the specificity they needed.</p>

    <p class = 'text-justify'>My goal is to actively minimize assumptions and allow the user to fill in this knowledge instead. One of the biggest assumptions I aim to remove in designing my app is the idea that any aspect of health exists individually. Instead, I consider the users health holistically, providing a space for users to make connections and see a more complete picture.</p>

    <p class = 'text-justify'>Having conducted user interviews and paper prototyping co-designs, the app is currently in a medium-fidelity prototyping space. In this space, I am working on the Figma prototype and conducting co-designs and tests with users.</p>
