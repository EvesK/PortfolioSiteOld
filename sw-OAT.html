    <p class = 'text-justify'>The Olin Accessibility Team, or OAT, is a small group of students, professors, and faculty working on accessibility initiatives at Olin College. I joined the team in Spring 2022 as the first student member and immediately began engaging in accessibility research at my school. In the Summer of 2022 I audited courses and advised instructors to help them create more accessible content and structure, wrote guides about assistive technology and accessible practices, and created video tutorials on accessibility in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and screen reader testing. </p>

    <p class = 'text-justify'>Through this work I have gained knowledge and experience with a variety of accessibility practices including but not limited to; ADA, WCAG, Section 503, Color Accessibility, creating accessible text documents and PDFs, and writing useful alternative text. Iâ€™ve also gained a lot of experience with crafting accessible communication in writing and videos.</p>

    <p class = 'text-justify'>In the Fall of 2022 I will be leading the development of a website, the Olin Accessibility Hub, which will host informative content for the Olin community. </p>
